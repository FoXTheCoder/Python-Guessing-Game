# Description
The Python Guessing Game is a simple text-based guessing game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. The game provides feedback to the player's guesses and includes a hint system to guide them toward the correct answer. It's a great project for beginners who want to practice their Python skills and understand basic programming concepts.

# Features
Random Number Generation: The game uses Python's random module to generate a secret number within a specified range.
User Input: Players can input their guesses, and the game validates and responds to their inputs.
Hint System: The game includes a hint system that provides information about whether the secret number is higher or lower than the player's guess, helping players make educated guesses.
Interactive Gameplay: Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the number correctly, adding a sense of challenge and engagement.

# How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the Python script using your preferred Python interpreter.
Follow the prompts to guess the secret number and use the hints to make informed guesses.
The game will provide feedback and let you know when you've guessed the number or when you've exhausted your attempts.

# Why This Project?
This project serves as an excellent introduction to Python programming for beginners. By working on this guessing game, you'll learn about fundamental concepts such as user input, conditional statements, loops, functions, and random number generation. Additionally, the hint system demonstrates how to add more complex logic to your programs.

Feel free to modify, expand, or customize the game to further enhance your learning experience. Enjoy coding and happy guessing!
